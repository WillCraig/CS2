# profiler - project 4
-William Craig




Okay so first we are going to go through everything and just read the source code.
Figure out what files are for testing and what contains real code.
Figure out the best way to go about testing what is happening within main.. - make little output tags above and below your little testing sandbox (use those tags{}})

make sure to ask if you can use your foreach loop instead of all of that nonsense iterator stuff










# Build Instructions (milestone 1)
Compile the program with:
```
$ make profiler
```
